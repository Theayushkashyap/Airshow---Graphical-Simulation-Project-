# Airshow---Graphical-Simulation-Project-
Airshow is a 6th-semester mini-project, a graphical simulation built with OpenGL and C++. It features dynamic smoke particles, a 3D environment with a bridge, and custom airplane models. We customized and enhanced existing code to fit our vision, creating a realistic and interactive simulation.
