**Airshow**
Airshow is a graphical simulation project built using OpenGL and C++ as part of our 6th-semester mini-project. This simulation includes dynamic smoke particles, a 3D environment featuring a bridge, and custom airplane models.

**Features**
Dynamic Smoke Simulation: Each smoke particle moves, rotates, and changes size and transparency over time, creating a lifelike effect.
Realistic Environment: A 3D bridge, ground textures, and a water body reflecting the entire scene provide an immersive environment.
Custom 3D Models: Airplanes with dynamic wings and fins were designed and implemented, adding to the realism of the simulation.
**Installation and Setup**
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

OpenGL: Required to run the graphical simulation.
GLUT: A library that helps with OpenGL utility functions.
C++ Compiler: Preferably GCC or similar that supports OpenGL and GLUT.
Code::Blocks (optional): A recommended IDE for running the project.
Steps to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https:(https://github.com/Theayushkashyap/Airshow---Graphical-Simulation-Project-)
cd Airshow
Open the Project in Code::Blocks (optional):

Open Code::Blocks and import the Airshow.cbp project file.
Alternatively, you can manually set up a new project and include all source files.
Build and Run:

If using Code::Blocks, click on the Build and Run button.
If using the command line, navigate to the project directory and compile the code with:
bash
Copy code
g++ -o airshow main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
./airshow
Enjoy the Simulation:

Once the program is running, you should see the smoke particles, airplanes, and the 3D environment in action.
Challenges Faced
We encountered several challenges, particularly in getting the smoke to interact naturally with the environment. Overcoming these challenges provided a valuable learning experience and led to the rewarding end result.

Customization and Learning
While there are existing source codes online, we took the time to understand, learn, and implement this project ourselves. We customized and enhanced the code to fit our vision, providing us with hands-on experience in graphics programming.
